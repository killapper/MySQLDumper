MySQLDumper.php generates MySQL dumps of specified hosts, compresses the file and uploads to the specified FTP location.
Useful for automated backups. Can be set as a cron job on the server. 

BackupDelete.php deletes backups on the FTP location older than specified Month(s) and Day(s).

The only drawback is, in case the data is huge, the PHP execution time limit set on shared hostings create a problem.
